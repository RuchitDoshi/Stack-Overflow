# Installation:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation:

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to better understand:

- Why is Stack Overflow a success? How does people give back to the community?
- How many languages are discussed in Stack Overflow?
- What methods does people follow for learning new programming technology without taking courses? 

These factors give a fair idea about different aspects of Stack Overflow's success.

# File description:
There are 2 Jupyter notebooks used in this project. The Stackoverflow.ipynb file is main file used to answer the above questions. GThe Extra-analysis.ipynb file contains extra visualizations carried to better understand the data set.

# Results:
The main findings of this project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@ruchitsd/why-is-stack-overflow-a-success-ccec4d87cd3f).

# Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgement
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
